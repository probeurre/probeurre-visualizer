This is the only work that occurs in the main thread.\n\n - We normalize and de-duplicate events to account for browser quirks. This\n   may be done in the worker thread.\n\n - Forward these native events (with the associated top-level type used to\n   trap it) to `EventPluginHub`, which in turn will ask plugins if they want\n   to extract any synthetic events.\n\n - The `EventPluginHub` will then process each event by annotating them with\n   \"dispatches\", a sequence of listeners and IDs that care about that event.\n\n - The `EventPluginHub` then dispatches the events.\n\nOverview of React and the event system:\n\n+------------+    .\n|    DOM     |    .\n+------------+    .\n      |           .\n      v           .\n+------------+    .\n| ReactEvent |    .\n|  Listener  |    .\n+------------+    .                         +-----------+\n      |           .               +--------+|SimpleEvent|\n      |           .               |         |Plugin     |\n+-----|------+    .               v         +-----------+\n|     |      |    .    +--------------+                    +------------+\n|     +-----------.--->|EventPluginHub|                    |    Event   |\n|            |    .    |              |     +-----------+  | Propagators|\n| ReactEvent |    .    |              |     |TapEvent   |  |------------|\n|  Emitter   |    .    |              |<---+|Plugin     |  |other plugin|\n|            |    .    |              |     +-----------+  |  utilities |\n|     +-----------.--->|              |                    +------------+\n|     |      |    .    +--------------+\n+-----|------+    .                ^        +-----------+\n      |           .                |        |Enter/Leave|\n      +           .                +-------+|Plugin     |\n+-------------+   .                         +-----------+\n| application |   .\n|-------------|   .\n|             |   .\n|             |   .\n+-------------+   .\n                  .\n   React Core     .

following order:\n\n`[R, S, C]`\n\nTo help illustrate the example, assume `S` is `SimpleEventPlugin` (for\n`onClick` etc) and `R` is `ResponderEventPlugin`.\n\n\"Deferred-Dispatched Events\":\n\n- The current event plugin system will traverse the list of injected plugins,\n  in order, and extract events by collecting the plugin's return value of\n  `extractEvents()`.\n- These events that are returned from `extractEvents` are \"deferred\n  dispatched events\".\n- When returned from `extractEvents`, deferred-dispatched events contain an\n  \"accumulation\" of deferred dispatches.\n- These deferred dispatches are accumulated/collected before they are\n  returned, but processed at a later time by the `EventPluginHub` (hence the\n  name deferred).\n\nIn the process of returning their deferred-dispatched events, event plugins\nthemselves can dispatch events on-demand without returning them from\n`extractEvents`. Plugins might want to do this, so that they can use event\ndispatching as a tool that helps them decide which events should be extracted\nin the first place.\n\n\"On-Demand-Dispatched Events\":\n\n- On-demand-dispatched events are not returned from `extractEvents`.\n- On-demand-dispatched events are dispatched during the process of returning\n  the deferred-dispatched events.\n- They should not have side effects.\n- They should be avoided, and/or eventually be replaced with another\n  abstraction that allows event plugins to perform multiple \"rounds\" of event\n  extraction.\n\nTherefore, the sequence of event dispatches becomes:\n\n- `R`s on-demand events (if any)   (dispatched by `R` on-demand)\n- `S`s on-demand events (if any)   (dispatched by `S` on-demand)\n- `C`s on-demand events (if any)   (dispatched by `C` on-demand)\n- `R`s extracted events (if any)   (dispatched by `EventPluginHub`)\n- `S`s extracted events (if any)   (dispatched by `EventPluginHub`)\n- `C`s extracted events (if any)   (dispatched by `EventPluginHub`)\n\nIn the case of `ResponderEventPlugin`: If the `startShouldSetResponder`\non-demand dispatch returns `true` (and some other details are satisfied) the\n`onResponderGrant` deferred dispatched event is returned from\n`extractEvents`. The sequence of dispatch executions in this case\nwill appear as follows:\n\n- `startShouldSetResponder` (`ResponderEventPlugin` dispatches on-demand)\n- `touchStartCapture`       (`EventPluginHub` dispatches as usual)\n- `touchStart`              (`EventPluginHub` dispatches as usual)\n- `responderGrant/Reject`   (`EventPluginHub` dispatches as usual)\n","info":{"type":"multiline","apidoc":true},"code":"function setResponderAndExtractTransfer("},"334":{"begin":334,"end":334,"codeStart":335,"content":"TODO: stop one short of the current responder.\n","info":{"type":"singleline"},"code":"  var bubbleShouldSetFrom = !responderInst ?"},"339":{"begin":339,"end":342,"codeStart":343,"content":"When capturing/bubbling the \"shouldSet\" event, we want to skip the target\n(deepest ID) if it happens to be the current responder.
